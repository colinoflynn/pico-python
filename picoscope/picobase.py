        It finds the smallest range that is capable of accepting your signal.
        Return actual range of the scope as double.

        The VOffset, is an offset that the scope will ADD to your signal.

        If using a probe (or a sense resitor), the probeAttenuation value is used to find
        the approriate channel range on the scope to use.

        e.g. to use a 10x attenuation probe, you must supply the following parameters
        ps.setChannel('A', "DC", 20.0, 5.0, True, False, 10.0)

        The scope will then be set to use the +- 2V mode at the scope allowing you to measure
        your signal from -25V to +15V.
        After this point, you can set everything in terms of units as seen at the tip of the probe.
        For example, you can set a trigger of 15V and it will trigger at the correct value.

        When using a sense resistor, lets say R = 1.3 ohm, you obtain the relation:

        V = IR, meaning that your probe as an attenuation of R compared to the current you are
        trying to measure.

        You should supply probeAttenuation = 1.3
        The rest of your units should be specified in amps.

        Unfortunately, you still have to supply a VRange that is very close to the allowed values.
        This will change in furture version where we will find the next largest range to
        accomodate the desired range.

        If you want to use units of mA, supply a probe attenuation of 1.3E3.
        Note, the authors recommend sticking to SI units because it makes it easier to guess
        what units each parameter is in.
