This is the base class that all picoscope modules use.

As much logic as possible is put into this file.
At minimum each instrument file requires you to modify the name of the API
function call (e.g. ps6000xxxx vs ps4000xxxx).

This is to force the authors of the instrument files to actually read the
documentation as opposed to assuming similarities between scopes.

        Set up a specific chthe scopeannel.

        It finds the smallest range that is capable of accepting your signal.
        Return actual range of the scope as double.

        The VOffset, is an offset that the scope will ADD to your signal.

        If using a probe (or a sense resitor), the probeAttenuation value is
        used to find the approriate channel range on the scope to use.

        e.g. to use a 10x attenuation probe, you must supply the following
        parameters ps.setChannel('A', "DC", 20.0, 5.0, True, False, 10.0)

        The scope will then be set to use the +- 2V mode at the scope allowing
        you to measure your signal from -25V to +15V.
        After this point, you can set everything in terms of units as seen at
        the tip of the probe. For example, you can set a trigger of 15V and it
        will trigger at the correct value.

        When using a sense resistor, lets say R = 1.3 ohm, you obtain the
        relation:
        V = IR, meaning that your probe as an attenuation of R compared to the
        current you are trying to measure.

        You should supply probeAttenuation = 1.3
        The rest of your units should be specified in amps.

        Unfortunately, you still have to supply a VRange that is very close to
        the allowed values. This will change in furture version where we will
        find the next largest range to accomodate the desired range.

        If you want to use units of mA, supply a probe attenuation of 1.3E3.
        Note, the authors recommend sticking to SI units because it makes it
        easier to guess what units each parameter is in.
